This project was just a little practice of my HTML and CSS skills.
The Form Website boasts a minimalistic approach that's pleasing to the eye.

The design of this website encourages soothing color-psychology with light and dark pastel blues,
and a smooth hovering effect of the submit button. At the end of the form, the user is greeted with a
text box, to reflect on the previous question(s).

Perhaps there is something to be learned, through the art of simple design.
